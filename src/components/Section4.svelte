		Metta is a central topic in buddhism and can be translated as loving kindness. It is more than
		love directed at one specific person, but rather an attitude of goodwill towards all beings,
		including oneself. There are many ways of how this principle can be applied. One way to live
		it is to practice loving kindness meditation. Send out all your love while meditating, to
		yourself, to people close to you, and finally to each and everyone. "May all beings be well and
		happy. May all beings have their heart filled with love." There are no limits to the creativity
		of your good wishes.
